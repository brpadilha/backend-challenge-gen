# About this project

This is a project made to resolve [this](https://github.com/lucasfonmiranda/gen-careers) backend challenge.

The [front-end]('https://github.com/brpadilha/front-end-challenge-gen') of this challenge.

# Project description

This project is to build a REST API that will communicate with two different payment services, stripe, and PayPal.

### API requirements:

- A route to create Clients;
- A route to create Transactions;
- A route to retrieve Clients;
- A route to retrieve transactions. It shall allow filtering by clients or payment service used;
- A transaction should be created in only one payment service (randomly chosen in each request);

### Different features

- I created a route session that controls what the client make the transaction and retrieve the transactions.

# Why?

This project is a part of my portfolio, that I wanted to improve my skills in resolving problems and create APIs.I will be happy if you provide me any feedback about this project, anything that you can report, can make me a better developer!

# Getting Started

<h3>Clonning the Repository</h3>

```
$ git clone git@github.com:brpadilha/backend-challenge-gen.git

$ cd backend-challenge-gen
```

<h3>Installing dependencies</h3>

```
$  yarn
```

<h3> Installing docker containers used in this project </h3>

Make sure that you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your computer on your computer, then run to install the containers:

```
$ docker run --name database -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

```
$ docker run --name mongobank -p 27017:27017 -d -t mongo
```

<h3> Migrate clients </h3>

I used the PostgresSQL db to register clients. So you will need to run the migrate of clients:

```
$ yarn sequelize db:migrate
```

I used [Postbird]('https://www.electronjs.org/apps/postbird) to check my PostgresSQL.
The login is:

```
Username: postgres
Password: docker
```

At the root of this project, you can find the `insomnia.json` that you can import on [insomnia]('https://insomnia.rest/download/') to make HTTP requests, how you saw at the beginning of this readme, view response details of this project.
